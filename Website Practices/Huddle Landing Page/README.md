## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
It's very straightfoward:
1. Went through the sample image
2. Formatted all the HTML codes
3. Styled elements from top down (header to footer)
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) - For icons

### What I learned

Didn't learn much, but this was a good practice. This was a chance for me to use some things I've never tried before - svg, pseudo classes and more

### Continued development

Use of flexbox - Not entirely familiar of align-content, justify-contents, align-items etc

Dynamic Website - Still unable to make this website respond to smaller screens. Will update it in the future. Here's the [github status for it](https://github.com/PetBed/petbed.github.io/issues/2)
